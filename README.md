Exercise 1: Multi-run script

Consider the program developed in Exercise 3 of Week 1.

<ul>

 <li>De ne the matrix dimension <em>N</em>as an input value to be read from</li>

 <li>Write a python script that changes <em>N </em>between two values <em>N<sub>min </sub></em>and <em>N<sub>max</sub></em>, and launches the program. Store the results in di erent les depending on the multiplication method used.</li>

 <li>Plot (using gnuplot) the results for the di erent multiplication methods.</li>

</ul>

Exercise 2: Automated            ts

Consider the program of the previous exercise.

<ul>

 <li>Fit the scaling of the time needed for di erent methods as a function of the input size. Considerthe biggest possible di erence between <em>N<sub>min </sub></em>and <em>N<sub>max</sub></em>.</li>

 <li>Save the gnuplot le you used in part (a) and exploit it to write a python script that performs automatically the previous ts.</li>

</ul>
